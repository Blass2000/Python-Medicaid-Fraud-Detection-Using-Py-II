The code in the GitHub repository at PCA_&_KMC_final.ipynb performs the following tasks:

Data Import and Preprocessing: Loads and cleans the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Scaling: Standardizes the data to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the analysis.

PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reduces the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the variance.

K-Means Clustering: Applies K-Means clustering to the reduced dataset to identify distinct groups or patterns.

Visualization: Plots the clusters and principal components to visualize the results of PCA and clustering.

Evaluation: Evaluates the clustering performance using metrics like the silhouette score.
